# ScarfaceClientTemplate
VRChat Client Quest Only (working on latest version of vrchat)

NOTE ALL CREDITS GO TO DEVS OF REMOD AND CYRIL, NEEKO and others, I just put this together mostly for myself but it is useful for people not wanting to use CRXC and just standalone.

This is a template to start developing mods for VRChat on Quest. VRChat Quest Modding is very undocumented so here i am releasing this :)
